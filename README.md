These scripts are to optimize the trinity assembly parameters. The script benchmark_trinity.pick.kc.kl.sp.sn.tp.sh includes
simulation of reads, batch assembly with different parameters, blastn to find the best reciprocal pairs and calculation of 
true positive rate. You need to have ncbi blast, trinity and another script from this 
repository - benchmark_trinity_blastnPlus_rbh_cov.pl downloaded and in your path.
